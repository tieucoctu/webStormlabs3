                <p>Once upon a younger year</br>
                   When all our shadows disappeared</br>
                   The animals inside came out to play</br>
                   When face to face with all our fears</br>
                   Learned our lessons through the tears</br>
                   Made memories</br>
                   We knew would never fade</br>
                   One day my father he told me</br>
                   Son don't let it slip away</br>
                   He took me in his arms</br>
                   I heard him say</br>
                   When you get older</br>
                   Your wild life will live</br>
                   For younger days</br>
                   Think of me if ever you're afraid</br>
                   He said</br>
                   One day you'll leave</br>
                   This world behind</br>
                   So live a life you will remember</br>
                   My father told me</br>
                   When I was just a child</br>
                   These are the nights that never die</br>
                   My father told me</br>
                   These are the nights that never die</br>
                   My father told me</br>
                   When thunder clouds</br>
                   Start pouring down</br>
                   Light a fire they can't put out</br>
                   Carve your name</br>
                   Into those shinning stars</br>
                   He said</br>
                   Go venture far beyond the shores</br>
                   Don't forsake this life of yours</br>
                   I'll guide you home</br>
                   No matter where you are</br>
                   One day my father</br>
                   He told me</br>
                   Son don't let it slip away</br>
                   When I was just a kid</br>
                   I heard him say</br>
                   When you get older</br>
                   Your wild life will live</br>
                   For younger days</br>
                   Think of me if ever you're afraid</br>
                   He said</br>
                   One day you'll leave</br>
                   This world behind</br>
                   So live a life you will remember</br>
                   My father told me</br>
                   When I was just a child</br>
                   These are the nights</br>
                   That never die</br>
                   My father told me</br>
                   These are the nights</br>
                   That never die</br>
                   My father told me</br>
