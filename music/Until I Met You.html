I saw you in my dreams
Middle of the night
You're everything I need
Together we're gold
My heart is sold to you
Saw you in the summer
Your face came to life
You can be my lover
The skies are blue
Our feelings grew
You hold me down
Set my soul on fire
Your voice that sound
Takes my body higher
Takes my body higher
Takes my body higher
Takes my body
Takes my body
Takes my body higher
Takes my body
Takes my body
Takes my body higher
Takes my body higher
Takes my body higher
Spent the days together
Melting in the sun
Skinny dipping weather
We fell so deep
Only took a week
Lazy afternoons
Laying in the sheets
I smell like her perfume
She's in my arms
My lucky charms
You hold me down
Set my soul on fire
Your voice that sound
Takes my body higher
Takes my body higher
Takes my body higher
Takes my body
Takes my body
Takes my body higher
Takes my body
Takes my body
Takes my body higher
Takes my body higher
Takes my body higher
Takes my body
Takes my body higher
Takes my body
Takes my body higher
Takes my body
Takes my body
Takes my body higher
Takes my body
Takes my body higher
Takes my body
Takes my body
Takes my body higher
Takes my body
Takes my body higher
Takes my body higher
Takes my body higher
