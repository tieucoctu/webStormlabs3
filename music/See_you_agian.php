        <h4>Singer: Wiz Khalifa, Charlie Puth</h4>
        <p>It's been a long day</br>
            Without you my friend</br>
            And I'll tell you all about it</br>
            When I see you again</br>
            We've come a long way</br>
            From where we began</br>
            Oh I'll tell you all about it</br>
            When I see you again</br>
            Damn who knew</br>
            All the planes we flew</br>
            Good things we've been through</br>
            That I'll be standing right here</br>
            Talking to you about another path</br>
            I know we loved to hit</br>
            The road and laugh</br>
            But something told me</br>
            That it wouldn't last</br>
            Had to switch up look at things</br>
            Different see the bigger picture</br>
            Those were the days</br>
            Hard work forever pays</br>
            Now I see you in a better place</br>
            It's been a long day</br>
            Without you my friend</br>
            And I'll tell you all about it</br>
            When I see you again</br>
            We've come a long way</br>
            From where we began</br>
            Oh I'll tell you all about it</br>
            When I see you again</br>
            Oh I'll tell you all about it</br>
            When I see you again</br>
        </p>
